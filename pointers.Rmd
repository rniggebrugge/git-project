## Some pointers on using Github from bash

### Cloning existing repository

* point bash to folder where you want to download rep to
* use **git clone <rep url>**, you will be asked for credentials
* folders is created. Ready!

### Editing files, seeing status

* edit files as you would normally do
* working with flat (text) files works best, otherwise it is difficult to keep track of changes
* use *git status* to see overview of changed, not commited files
