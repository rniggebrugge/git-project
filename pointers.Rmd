#### Some pointers on using Github from bash

##### Cloning existing repository

* point bash to folder where you want to download rep to
* use **git clone <rep url>**, you will be asked for credentials
* folders is created. Ready!

##### Editing files, seeing status

* edit files as you would normally do
* working with flat (text) files works best, otherwise it is difficult to keep track of changes
* use **git status** to see overview of changed, not commited files
* use **git diff <filename>** to see differences between staged and changed files

##### Staging files, ready to be commited

* use **git add <filename>** to stage file
* use **git status** again to see all staged files
* **!!!!** use **git status -s** to have a brief status overview
 
##### Committing files

* use **git commit** and a text editor will open where the commit message can be edited
* alternatively use **git commit -m <message>** to quickly commit using small message
* 

##### Removing and moving files

Removing:

* use **rm <filename>**
* then **git rm <filename>**
* the next commit it will be gone

Moving:

* use **git mv <old_file> <new_file>** to move file around (probably including possible directory path)
